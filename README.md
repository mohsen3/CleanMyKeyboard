# Introduction

`CleanMyKeyboard` is a simple windows application that allows you to clean
the keyboard (and touch screen monitor) of your computers without turning them off.
The app comes in handy specially on laptops where keyboards are not as easy to detach and
screens are touch enabled.
The binary can be downloaded [from this link](https://github.com/mohsen3/CleanMyKeyboard/blob/master/bin/CleanMyKeyboard-1.0.0.exe?raw=true).

The source and binary are published under BSD3 license.

The credit of the idea of this app goes to the author of
[Keyboard Cleaner](http://jan.prima.de/~jan/plok/archives/48-Keyboard-Cleaner.html),
the app that I used for a long time on my Mac Book and missed it when I switched to Windows.

I am not a `C#` or `.NET` developer by any means.
Comments/pull requests are appreciated.
